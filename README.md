### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Pasqua101/Pasqua101** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. --!>
<h3>I'm Marco, a third year Computer Science student at Ontario Tech Univeristy. </h3>

<p>On here, you can find some of my previous projects from Seneca College. As well as some of my older projects from high school, which first made me interested in 
pursing a career in this field.
</p>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning Git, Unix, and Discrete Math.<br>
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Mobile app development. <br>
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him <br> 
- âš¡ Fun fact: History buff and video game enthusiast. <br>

<br>
<p>
Other than the Python code and Java code I have developed from high school, all other code is not to be copied pasted to solve homework. Since it violates academic integrity. Because it's impossible to stop people from looking at my answers, I encourage you to analyze the code and understand how it works before defaulting on the option of copy paste.
